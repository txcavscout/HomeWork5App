HomeWork5App

Objective:
Create an array of 3 names. Ask the user which number to select. When the user gives you a number, return that name. Make sure to check for invalid numbers.

I also added:
Non number check, loop to keep user in program until 5 is chosen to quit. 

Makes use of if else and switch
